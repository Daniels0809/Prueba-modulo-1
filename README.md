#Option 1. Add product:

-Be careful not to enter incorrect data such as letters with numbers, numbers, empty data, or characters other than letters, as they will not be accepted and a comment will appear so you don't do it again.
-Also, when entering the product, first check that it is not duplicated.
-Next, you will be asked to enter the product price. Also, make sure there are no incorrect data such as letters, negative numbers, etc.
-Next, you will enter the available quantity; this also has the same price restrictions.
-Done, after entering the data as requested, the product will be added with its respective price and available quantity.

#Option 2. Search for a product:
-You must enter the name of the product you wish to search for. Blank fields, numbers, or if the product is not in stock are not accepted.

- After correctly entering the product, it will tell you whether it was found or not. If it was, it will tell you its current price so you can change it by entering the new price.
- If you enter the new price correctly, it will confirm it. If you enter the data incorrectly, it will continue asking you until you do it correctly.
- After this, if you want to continue, enter the next product. If not, then type "exit."
